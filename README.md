## Project Objective 🎯

Develop a **sophisticated machine learning model** to **accurately classify** emails as either **spam** or **ham (legitimate)** using **Logistic Regression** combined with **regularization techniques**:  
✅ Lasso (L1)  
✅ Ridge (L2)  
✅ Elastic Net  

Key Goals:
- 📈 Handle high-dimensional and sparse data.
- 🛡️ Mitigate multicollinearity.
- 🧹 Select relevant features automatically.
- 🏆 Optimize model performance through robust tuning and evaluation.

## Introduction 📖

In today's digital world, spam emails present major challenges—wasting resources and posing security threats.  
This project tackles real-world email classification problems, addressing:

- High-dimensional sparse features
- Severe multicollinearity
- Feature extraction complexity
- Class imbalance issues

**Why Regularization?**  
Applying L1, L2, and Elastic Net techniques **enhances model generalization**, **improves interpretability**, and **avoids overfitting**.

## Dataset Description 📂

**SpamAssassin Public Corpus** – A trusted dataset for spam classification research.

**Composition**:
- 📩 `spam_2`: Spam emails (label = 1)
- ✉️ `easy_ham`: Clear non-spam (label = 0)
- ✉️ `hard_ham`: Challenging non-spam (label = 0)

**Features**:
- Email headers (From, Subject, etc.)
- MIME content types
- Email bodies (plain text/HTML)

**Preprocessing Highlights**:
- ✂️ Remove irrelevant headers and artifacts.
- 🔄 Normalize and clean email bodies.
- 🛠️ Handle missing values and encoding inconsistencies.
